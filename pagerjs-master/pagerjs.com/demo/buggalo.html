<h1>Where the Buggalo Roam</h1>

<p>What are their names? And until then, I can never die? Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! I
    barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.
    That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid
    thing.</p>

<h2>Put Your Head on my Shoulder</h2>

<p>Fatal. I'm Santa Claus! Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think?</li>
    <li>With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!</li>
    <li>Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it.</li>
    <li>Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've
        done anything at all.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>The Series Has Landed</h3>

<p>Anyone who laughs is a communist! Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting
    trial for that there incompetence. Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory.
    Bender?! You stole the atom.</p>
<h4>The Day The Earth Stood Stupid</h4>

<p>No, just a regular mistake. Hello, little man. I will destroy you! Alright, let's mafia things up a bit.
    Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?</li>
    <li>Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Love's Labors Lost in Space</h5>

<p>And then the battle's not so bad? I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. And from now on you're all
    named Bender Jr.</p>
