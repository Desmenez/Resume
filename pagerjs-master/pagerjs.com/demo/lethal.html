<h1>Lethal Inspection</h1>

<p>I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. Say what? File not found. Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm
    going to come back there and change your opinions manually! Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day,
    the Internet was only used to download pornography. And from now on you're all named Bender Jr.</p>

<h2>Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles</h2>

<p>Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool.
    Hello, little man. I will destroy you! In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms.
    These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are.</p>

<h3>The Luck of the Fryrish</h3>

<p>Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're
    partying with Slurms McKenzie! Ow, my spirit!</p>
<h4>Space Pilot 3000</h4>

<p>Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! I just want
    to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it
    for so long. Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Anyone who laughs is a communist!</p>
<ol>
    <li>I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died.</li>
    <li>Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died.</li>
    <li>Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!</li>
    <li>Who am I making this out to?</li>
</ol>
<h5>The Mutants Are Revolting</h5>

<p>Take me to your leader! It's toe-tappingly tragic! Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. But, like most
    politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.</p>
